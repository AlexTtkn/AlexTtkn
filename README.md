### üôÇ About me
I am searching for a job as a Java developer. Ready to participate in an interview or complete a test assignment. I have finished Java programming courses and projects during my studies, which have provided me with a strong foundation in Java programming and software development principles which I am ready to apply in practice. I would love to join a team of professionals and contribute to the growth of projects.  I am open to feedback and willing to work to improve my skills and be helpful for the team.

<summary>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</summary>
My name is Alex and I have worked as an electrician for many years. I was not passionate about technology and anything to do with computers.
Despite the fact that my profession was not related to the IT industry, I came into contact with IT specialists because the company I worked for had equipment that required the automation of processes using various electronic devices. We often worked together and exchanged experiences in our common field of activity.

Gradually, my interest in how these systems worked grew, and in my spare time I began to study programming languages and technologies.
However, my job as an electrician did not give me the opportunity to develop in this area. 

Over time I realised that I wanted to work as a programmer and create new programs. I started learning Java and soon decided to retrain as a programmer.

The motivation for my desire to become a programmer is that I want to create new programs and solve complex problems.
I believe that my passion for technology and programming will help me succeed in this profession.
As an electrician, I have worked in a team with other electricians, engineers and designers, and my experience will help me as a programmer, as I know the importance of communicating and working effectively with colleagues. I understand that software development is a collective process and I am willing to work towards a common goal.
